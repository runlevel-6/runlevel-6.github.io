<p>The CentOS KVM/Qemu hypervisor can be setup in short order and provides all of the tools necessary to support enterprise class virtualization. Create and manage VMs and virtual networks. We begin with a quick 5 minute install of CentOS minimal. Then add virtualization packages and desired utilities with some follow-on configuration activities. It installs and sets up quickly into just about any modern virt-capable host hardware you can imagine. <strong>From enterprise grade servers, to desktop, or even laptop systems.</strong> I have implemented it many times in both CentOS 6 and CentOS 7. I like the new systemd and graphical firewall-config in CentOS 7.</p>

<p>The hypervisor host can be used for research, development, and/or production systems. It provides <strong>graphical management</strong> of virtual machines, virtual networking, and other related resources. It can be easily managed remotely from Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X desktops using a graphical program called
<a href="http://virt-manager.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Machine Manager</a>, invoked simply as &ldquo;virt-manager&rdquo;. Alternatively, command line or scripted management is also possible using a powerful <a href="http://libvirt.org/" target="_blank">libvirt</a>-based program called <a href="http://libvirt.org/virshcmdref.html" target="_blank">Virsh</a>, invoked simply as &ldquo;virsh&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The hypervisor can also be used as a OS provisioning platform for <strong>virtual desktop interface (VDI)</strong> using accelerated
<a href="http://www.spice-space.org/" target="_blank">Spice</a>
or standard common VNC. The Spice protocol and tools provide a very responsive desktop experience delivered to client from VM.</p>

<p>Select the setup guide here for detailed instructions covering both CentOS 6 and CentOS 7 systems.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>After a night of heavy rain we have an inch of water in the drivers-side interior footwell!</strong></p>

<p>I am posting this information with hope that it might help others who are experiencing the same problem I had. If you find it of good use, please drop me an email. Please read the disclaimer at the bottom of this document.</p>

<p>The 2007 Saab 93 door leak root cause. A torn foam-panel interior door seal.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-saab/5-torn-foam-seal.png" alt="Saab 93" /></p>

<h2>Forward</h2>

<p>In this article we illustrate a solution for a leaking interior door panel on a 2007 Saab 93 2.0t that was discovered in November of 2012.</p>

<h2>Problem described:</h2>

<p>We have had water leaking in on the driver&rsquo;s side for several months, but only after a very heavy rain. On two occasions we had more than an inch of water accumulate!</p>

<h2>Investigation</h2>

<p>I ran a garden hose on the drivers side window for about 2 or 3 minutes and noticed that water was leaking into the interior at the very bottom of the plastic panel attached to the drivers door. The body door seal actually prevents the water from exiting at the bottom of the door opening so it leaks into the cabin and runs onto the carpet into the drivers foot area.</p>

<p>To investigate the root cause, I carefully separated the door panel from the door frame along the lower part of the door. I noticed that the foam seal panel inside the door was damaged, torn up and not connected (adhered to the metal door frame) as it should have been.</p>

<h2>When did the damage occur? At the service dealer 2 years before!</h2>

<p>This got me wondering, since we purchased the car used but still under factory warranty at the time it was purchased. I called the dealer service who confirmed that the car had service performed on the drivers door two years back to replace the window actuator. Apparently the service technician or mechanic, during replacement of the window actuator, had torn up the interior door seal and not bothered to replace or repair it properly. This interior door seal is a thin closed cell foam panel that tears easily when servicing the door mechanics. The panel is adhered to the lower part of the inside of the door and works to keep water moving towards the outside of the door cavity and properly through the drain holes at the bottom of the door.</p>

<p>The attending service manager claimed that the work on the door actuator was guaranteed for 1 year, so the fact that the interior door seal was damaged during that process is past due and there is nothing they can do about it&ndash;even though THEY damaged it in 2010. There was absolutely no way I could tell that the work was substandard without removing the door panel to see it inside the door assembly. So much for professional service and standing by your work. That will be the last time that service dealer gets my business.</p>

<h2>Lesson for service done on a door</h2>

<p>So to make a long story short: If you have ever had work done on the inside of a Saab door, it is imperative that the foam panel seal within the door assembly not be breached. If the seal is not attached properly or is damaged or torn in the repair process you may end up with a door that leaks into the cabin during heavy rains.</p>

<p>Perhaps after service door repairs, a good test at home would be to spray water on the door window for about 15 or 20 minutes to test the seal and make sure the service technician got the seal set up properly. Of course this could be done at the service dealer as part of the repair process to make sure the door handles water properly after service.</p>

<h2>Saab design issue?</h2>

<p>Looking at the Saab door design closely, it is clearly evident that the windows seam at the top of the door is located directly above the lower part of the interior door panel instead of the lower part of the door assembly. This means that any water entering the door-window seam and falling straight down will strike the foam panel and interior parts of the door before finding its way back to the door well drain holes. This particular choice of design makes it imperative that the foam door panel not be breached. I am not sure if this situation occurs in other sporty cars, like the Saab, which tend to have a tapered wider stance at the base of the vehicle when viewed from the front or back of the car. This does help make the car look more appealing and perhaps improves handling by distributing more mass at the base of the car&ndash;a lower center of gravity.</p>

<h2>Repair or replace the part?</h2>

<p>A new foam seal is ~$140 (USD). That is an insane amount of money for a simple piece of foam&ndash;typical service part highway robbery. I will take a stab at fixing it myself. I will use rubberized sealant and transparent box tape. It won&rsquo;t look great, but who cares because the repair work will only be visible if you remove the interior door panel. If I <strong>ever</strong> have to tear out the panel for future repair work on a windows actuator I will consider buying a new foam panel&ndash;but not until then.</p>

<h2>Repairing the foam seal.</h2>

<p>Here are the steps I went through to repair the foam seal in the door. It was very easy and took only a few minutes&hellip;</p>

<p>First we heat the door handle with a hair dryer. We want to get the plastic hot so it can flex more easily.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-saab/1-heating-door-handle.png" alt="heating up the door handle" /></p>

<p>After the door handle has been warmed up, we can gently pull and easily snap off the plastic door handle cover.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-saab/2-door-handle-cover-removed.png" alt="door handle plastic cover removed" /></p>

<p>Now we must remove two torx bolts which hold the door handle to the door frame.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-saab/3-star-driver-upper-handle.png" alt="door panel upper torx" /></p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-saab/4-star-driver-lower-handle.png" alt="door panel lower torx" /></p>

<p>We then gently snap the door panel away and lift it gently to detach it from the door frame. We must be careful with the plastic snaps. The door panel remains loosely attached near the door lever. We can now inspect the the torn foam door seal.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-saab/5-torn-foam-seal.png" alt="torn interior door seal" /></p>

<p>Lifting the lower section of the torn foam seal exposes the interior cavity of the door. This is where the water is coming from. The water runs along the torn foam panel and drops onto the interior door panel. From there it enters the cabin.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-saab/6-leak-point.png" alt="inner door cavity exposed" /></p>

<p>We carefully use the rubberized sealant to repair the tear in the foam seal. We add quality transparent box tape to further mend any tears and spread the sealant across the tearing. It does not look like new, but it works just fine. The unsightly repair work will be covered completely when the interior door panel is snapped back into position.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-saab/7-repaired-foam-seal.png" alt="repaired door seal" /></p>

<p>Afterwards, a lengthy garden hose test reveals that the repair work did the job! The door no longer leaks into the interior of the cabin.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>We successfully repaired the leaking door on the 2007 Saab 93 2.0t. The work took about one hour and we spent about $5. We saved at least $140 in the process and learned a few things along the way. All in all it was a big win-win. <strong>That is $5 and one hour of fussing around!</strong></p>

<p>The solution has worked flawlessly for 18 months, including winter and now several torrential spring rains. We still have the option to replace the foam seal whenever we want to endure the $140 cost. I might consider, instead of cheap flimsy foam, using a custom fit piece of durable 4 or 6 mil plastic visquene.</p>

<p>If we had the service dealer fix it, we would have spent $140 for the part, and at least $90 for the labor. On top of that we would had to drive to the service dealer twice resulting in 2 hours of travel time&ndash;the dealer is 30 minutes away from my home. <strong>That is $230 and 2 hours of our time and travel costs.</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My wife and I had been living in our home, with children, for a number of years and decided it was time for general improvement of the basement. The basement was basically roughed-in but nothing was done beyond what was required for the basic requirements to satisfy the building code. It was not a living area for our home and we wanted to create a living area for our family to enjoy.</p>

<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>After much careful thought, I decided to proceed with the project on my own. I had some home construction experience, from many years back, working with my dad as part of his construction company, Equity Builders, in Lorain, Ohio. My father was an exceptional carpenter and I gained a great appreciation of carpentry and general contracting working with him. I also have an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering&ndash;so the electrical elements of the project came along reasonably easily for me as did the general construction. I did have to do some research on building and electrical codes to make sure everything I was doing would be within the limits of building codes in my area.</p>

<p>The advantages of DIY include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Saving a considerable amount of money</li>
<li>Ability to provide a great job for my two sons to learn and earn money.</li>
<li>Everyone learning lots of new concepts and skills</li>
<li>Remaining in complete control of the job along the way</li>
</ul>


<p>The disadvantages of DIY:</p>

<ul>
<li>Taking more time to complete the project</li>
<li>Spending a few hundred, or so, hours of my time in the basement instead of doing other things</li>
</ul>


<h3>Warning&hellip;</h3>

<p>If you decide to try a basement improvement project on your own make sure you do enough research to understand what you are getting into. Find some experienced people to talk with about the project if you do not have enough experience yourself. Plan the project in phases and celebrate the completion of each phase. If you are unsure about anything you are doing, then get some help. It can be very costly to have to tear something apart because it was not built properly. There are also many dangers that you will encounter in the building process&ndash;power tools, adhesives, paints, electrical distribution components, etc.. The risk of getting seriously hurt goes up dramatically if you don&rsquo;t know what you are doing. Most importantly you want to end up with a safe living environment when you are done&ndash;so pay close attention to building, electrical, and plumbing codes&ndash;think seriously about these and don&rsquo;t be afraid to spend some extra money to make sure the new living environment is safe.</p>

<p>If you do not have experience consider doing some smaller jobs first, then gradually working your way up. Perhaps even helping a professional complete a job, as a part time learning experice. You can offer your help for less, as a means to gain valuable part time on-the-job experience.</p>

<h3>Site Considerations</h3>

<p>When we had our home built, we specified deeper 13 course block basement with the thought that we might eventually improve the basement into a living area. The distance from basement floor to upper level exposed floor joists is about 8 &frac12; feet. Having the deeper basement allowed enough room to build soffits and ceiling into the basement yet provide for a generous amount of head room. The cost of the additional row of block for the basement, at the time the home was built, was around $400&ndash;a worthwhile investment. The basement has a generous amount of open floor space free from utilites above it. It is very dry and we have never had any water issues. The home is built on one of the higher level lots in the development.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>To get the plan started I created a drawing using a CAD tool. I picked an open source tool called LibreCAD to do the drawing. I spent several weeks just drawing, correcting, sketching, and planning what improvements would be made and how to accomplish the task. My original drawings had a small kitchen included, but that was scaled back because of space and cost concerns. Once we had an aggreable plan, I procrastinated for a few months, then began doing the work. I have done most everything so far, with some occasional help from a few of my friends on some of the larger and/or heavier tasks&ndash;such as the drywall finishing. I also had my 15 year old son help me, who learned many skills while doing so. I learned quite a bit also, and continue to learn as I work to complete the project. My older son is also helping me now, when he can, and is also learning much about building.</p>

<h3>Proceeding to build</h3>

<p>With the improvement plan drawing complete, we now have the confidence needed to move forward. We are now in the build phase of the project. We are working the project in phases and decided to leave the last phase, the bathroom, for a later time&ndash;much later. Work has not been moving as quickly as I originally expected but we are making steady progress&ndash;it is a rather large project for one person. It has become a regular part-time weekend job. I am doing most of the work on my own with some help occasionally from my two sons.</p>

<p>Below is the framing work for the first build which divided the basement into entertainment and utility space.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/IMG_2243_400x267.png" alt="furnace room" /></p>

<p>The plan calls for more electrical capacity in the basement&ndash;a lot more. The main panel is nearly out of slots. Here I have added a side-car distribution panel for the finished side of the basement. It will carry the 240V baseboard heater load, wall outlets, and light utilities for the finished side of the basement.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/distribution-side-car_400x267.png" alt="furnace room" /></p>

<p>The side-car distribution is operational. I have a bit more work to do on it. I still need to tie the romex down with some staples and complete the layout document sheet on the inside of the door.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/distribution-side-car-2_400x267.png" alt="furnace room" /></p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/distribution-side-car-3_400x267.png" alt="furnace room" /></p>

<p>Here we have our friendly home electrician&ndash;me. The switches in the 4 gang electrical workbox all operate perfectly. A happy camper indeed&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/IMG_2259_400x600.png" alt="electrical" /></p>

<p>With the electrical rough in complete, we can begin to mud, sand smooth, and then prime-coat the walls. Dry wall and finishing is labor intensive and very messy. This was about as big of a drywall job as I could put up with and I got some help on the finishing work from my brother in law. The job seemed to take forever and was very messy.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/IMG_2380_400x267.png" alt="finishing walls" /></p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/IMG_2379_400x267.png" alt="finishing walls" /></p>

<p>Here you can see the positioning of the recessed lights on the finished side of the basement. Note the mason string line used as a guide to position the lights in two parallel lines across the basement. If you want a straight line, use a very taught string.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/recessed-lights-layout_400x267.png" alt="positioning recessed lights" /></p>

<p>On to the prime coat and finish woodwork. We still have a few places on the walls that need a bit more more attention. I am waiting to do the final touchups until all the woodwork is complete. I found that the installation process for the finish woodworking occasionally tends to ding up the walls here and there. One final fresh coat of paint near the end of the project should take care of everything.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/IMG_4437_400x267.png" alt="finishing walls" /></p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/IMG_4438_400x267.png" alt="finishing walls" /></p>

<p>Here we are now below, into the second build which adds a central soffit to cover the overhead beam and air ducts and finished walls to cover most of the foundation. The second build will complete the division of the basement with an addition of another internal partition with a doorway. The goal for the second build is to complete the living area ceiling, walls, and woodwork&ndash;bringing it into full completion except for the floor. Part of this second build is now complete with woodwork and finish work complete. Note the recessed ceiling lights.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/IMG_2970_400x267.png" alt="furnace room" /></p>

<p>Now we move on to finishing the ugly support posts. We use a combination of a level and a keen line-of-sight to make sure the support posts are aligned with each other and plumb before we start&ndash;they are. I cut some 2x4s to length and run a shallow angled groove down the center. I use two heavy U-bolts on each post to clamp a 2x4 onto the post&ndash;then apply adhesive. We take special care to use only straight 2x4s, and align their surface at the proper position on the post to be parallel with the room wall. This provides a rock-solid and truly aligned nailing surface for the first piece of poplar 1x8 woodwork which is glued and nailed onto the 2x4. We make sure to use a level to plumb the first poplar 1x8 for a good start on each post.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/post-finishing-1_400x267.png" alt="post finishing 1" /></p>

<p>With the first piece nailed and glued directly to the 2x4, we now work our way around the post, nailing each edge of the 1x8 poplar to the edge of the previous piece with a 15 gauge nail gun&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/post-finishing-2_400x267.png" alt="post finishing 2" /></p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/post-finishing-3_400x267.png" alt="post finishing 3" /></p>

<p>Afterwards, we fill nail holes using Minwax Woodfiller, then using a sandpaper stapled to a large wood-block - a sanding block. We sand all of the surfaces first with course, then with fine sandpaper. It takes lots of sanding to get it just right. We dont want to see any machine marks or feel any mis-aligned joints. The finished product is worth the effort. We still have trim to complete at the top and bottom of the posts and will get to that after the ceiling is complete.</p>

<p>The posts are looking great so far and you can also see how the central soffit finished out. The paired electrical workboxes in the soffit are one for electrical supply and another for DMX computer light interface&ndash;added to the project for fun and entertainment&ndash;this place is eventually going to rock!</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/post-finishing-4_400x267.png" alt="post finishing 4" /></p>

<p>We are now getting ready to apply the ceiling material on the uppermost ceiling surface at the floor joists, which will be a tongue-and-groove solid wood SPF siding product. The ceiling material will be nailed to a sub-ceiling that we build out using 1.5&#8221; x 0.75&#8221; firring strips. Below we are using a laser level&ndash;my friend Rich loaned it to me. The masking tape markers are carefully stuck in place, using the laser level, to the desired position for the sub-ceiling&ndash;very close to the the floor joists. The folded tape ends provide a perfectly flat guide for the sub-ceiling nailers which will be glued and nailed to the level of tape markers.</p>

<p>Trying to forgo the firring strips and nail the ceiling directly to the floor joists would create far too much height variation in the finished ceiling because the bottoms of the floor joists are not leveled perfectly with each other. Floor joists tend to be crowned and flat to various degrees. Their with can vary in some cases. Loading on the upper deck can cause some variations as well. The firring strips make it all come out perfectly flat.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/laser-level_400x267.png" alt="laser level" /></p>

<p>Here the sub-ceiling nailers are going into place at the exact position the masking tape markers were hung. This effectively flattens the ceiling in preparation for the finished product. The clamp was used as a helping hand to hold up the nailer while it is being positioned and nailed.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/ceiling-leveling_400x267.png" alt="sub-ceiling with recessed light" /></p>

<p>I like to keep the tools together and organized. This helps prevent me from spending too much time in search of tools that were left laying around.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/tools-1_400x323.png" alt="sub-ceiling with recessed light" /></p>

<p>Using a 15 gauge nail gun really saves time. You can see how the clamp is used to make handling and aligning the material much easer while nailing it.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/nailing-subceiling_400x325.png" alt="sub-ceiling nailing gun" /></p>

<p>More sub-ceiling nailers going into place. The entire sub-ceiling is coming out perfectly flat&ndash;just what we need.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/ceiling-leveling-2_400x267.png" alt="sub-ceiling progress" /></p>

<p>We use a string to mark and position the first piece of ceiling material. A tight string does not lie&ndash;it gives you a perfectly straigt line to work from.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/string-layout-1_400x267.png" alt="sub-ceiling progress" /></p>

<p>We transfer the line produced by the string onto the subceiling nailers. This line markes the position for the first piece of &frac34; inch ceiling material. We want to get a perfectly aligned and straight start&ndash;to which the remaining material will be aligned to. We could have used a chalk line but I didn&rsquo;t want to bother with blue chalk dust cleanup afterwards.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/string-layout-2_400x267.png" alt="sub-ceiling progress" /></p>

<p>Here is the start on the ceiling for one section of the basement. The material is nailed using 2 inch 15 gauge nails driven from a Senco nail gun. First piece is spot glued and nailed on both edges of the material&ndash;we want a good foundation piece that will not move. The second and remaining &frac34; inch SPF material is spot glued and nailed at the leading edge, just behind the tongue, to the sub-ceiling nailers. The job is rather cumbersome and requires two people to position, hold, and nail each piece into place. The ceiling is extremely solid&ndash;you can bounce a basketball against it. It adds to the stiffness and structure of the flooring system directly above it.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/ceiling-finish-start_400x300.png" alt="sub-ceiling progress" /></p>

<p>The natural wood is really looking great so far. The edges will be eventually be finished out with crown molding, nail holes filled, and a final coat of finish will be applied to the entire ceiling. This is the small section of basement ceiling. On the other side of the soffit the ceiling area is at least 3 times the size of this one. &hellip;we still have lots of ceiling work to do.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/ceiling_400x267.png" alt="upper ceiling and soffit" /></p>

<p>Getting back to working on the ceiling I find that I am working mainly on my own. I decided to make a set of support brackets to help install the ceiling material on the larger side of the basement. I need something to hold the material in place with enough force so that it will stay in place and allow me to adjust it before nailing it. What I learned from working on the smaller side is that it is very difficult to hold the first piece and others in place before nailing them. These brackets below will allow me to position and secure the piece before nailing it. I took some quick measurements and spent 30 minutes or so making these from scrap material. The bracket is designed to slide along the sub-ceiling nailers.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/support-bracket-2_400x460.png" alt="upper ceiling and soffit" /></p>

<p>You can see how the foam wedge provides enough force to hold the material firmly against the ceiling. This is great. It allows me to carfully align the material before nailing it. I am just getting started on the first row of material on the larger section of ceiling.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/support-bracket-use-1_400x267.png" alt="upper ceiling and soffit" /></p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/support-bracket-use-2_400x254.png" alt="upper ceiling and soffit" /></p>

<p>All of the end cuts are made on a compound miter saw. I really like the DeWalt&ndash;it is easy to use and cuts perfectly.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/saw-crosscut-1_400x267.png" alt="upper ceiling and soffit" /></p>

<p>I have the saw set to undercut each piece by a few degrees. This helps prevent visual gaps when butted to another piece of material.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/saw-overcut_4639_400x267.png" alt="upper ceiling and soffit" /></p>

<p>The first row of material has been spot-glued and nailed in place. It is looking as straight as the string we used earlier to mark the position. Using the support-brackets made a big difference in the amount of effort. It takes me far less effort now, working alone, than it did earlier with two people trying to align and muscle the material around without the bracket.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-basement/first-run-west-side-1_400x267.png" alt="upper ceiling and soffit" /></p>

<p>After completing the open ceilings, we will be adding crown molding and finishing out the woodwork down the walls and at the floor base. Although we still have lots of work to do to complete the second build, the basement living area is starting to look like a great place to hang out.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more as we complete the project&hellip;</p>

    <id>http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/blog/2013/04/21/electric-range-repair-can-i-do-it-myself</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am posting this information with hope that it might help others who are experiencing the same problem. If you find it of good use, please drop me an email to let me know. Please read the disclaimer at the bottom of this document.</p>

<p>Below is a range which has two top burners no longer working. It is currently a two-burner range. We need to fix it.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-1_400x393.png" alt="range front top view" /></p>

<h2>Forward</h2>

<p>Two of the top burners on our home Frigidaire range stopped working over the past year. The range has been in service for 12 years. The center section of the right-front dual element burner and the front section of the dual burner left-side element no longer work. With both burners out, the range has become frustrating to use with only two functional elements&ndash;three if you count the warming element. I need to do something about it.</p>

<h2>Options to consider</h2>

<p>After some investigation on the Internet the best prices I could find was $200 for the left side burner and $113 for the large right-front burner. What gives with those prices? That&rsquo;s $313 plus $7 shipping for what amounts to parts that look like they cost less than $10 each to manufacture. These things should not cost more than a simple toaster&ndash;about $20 each. I can buy a brand new electric range for less than $500! Why are these parts so expensive? There is simply no way I would spend that much on a 12 year old range! It will get replaced with a new unit if I can&rsquo;t fix it here and now with my own tools&hellip;</p>

<h2>The decision</h2>

<p>With nothing really to lose with this range, I decide to try to take a rather <strong>unconventional approach</strong> and repair the range elements <strong>by hand</strong>. If I could pull this off, it will save us from having to replace the range, which would be about $500 - $700. I decide at this point that I will never buy a glass-top range again and it will not be a Frigidaire. I have been thoroughly dissapointed with all of our Frigidaire appliances, including this range.</p>

<h2>Warning</h2>

<p>If you decide to try repairing a range based on the information at this site or any other information, then you had better know what you are doing. Most importantly, make sure the range is unplugged before, and while, attempting to perform any work on it. Read the disclaimer at the end of this page.</p>

<h2>Proceeding with the repair work&hellip;</h2>

<p>Below are the tools and materials I used for the job. Note the connector kit, in the blue container, which was purchased a few years back at the local hardware store. One of the wooden firring strips will be used to hold up the rangetop.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-24_400x250.png" alt="tools used to repair range" /></p>

<p>Below is the range which I have already removed from the counter area. It is inplugged and ready to be diagnosed. The remaining pictures tell the story from start to finish.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-2_400x194.png" alt="front view of range" /></p>

<p>Below I have removed the four mounting scews at the side of the range top and have supported, from the back, the rangetop. This is a view from the rear of the range. I had someone hold the rangetop secure while working on it. There is no hinge at the front to prevent it from sliding out of place and falling&ndash;which almost happened to me. Securing it temporarily at the front with duct tape might also have been a good approach.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-3_400x307.png" alt="range top lifted with support" /></p>

<p>Below is right-front burner element, fully exposed and ready for diagnosis.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-4_400x261.png" alt="range right-front heat element" /></p>

<p>Below is a multi-meter which I will be using as a simple continuity tester to try to determine if and where a break in the heating element might be located.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-5_400x267.png" alt="electronic multi-meter" /> |</p>

<p>I spent three minutes, or so, testing the continuity on portions of the heating element until I located a break point in the element&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-6_400x267.png" alt="testing heating element for fault" /></p>

<p>The red circle shows the break point in the heating element. It is the common conductor element for the small center portion of the element. I lifted it slightly from the coil to better illustrate it.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-7-marked_400x267.png" alt="fault identified" /></p>

<p>In the next few picures, I fabricate a small specialized crimping connector from a standard aluminum alloy connector in the kit. I will use it to mend the break in the heating element.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-8_400x273.png" alt="connector" /></p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-9_400x287.png" alt="connector bent" /></p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-10_400x238.png" alt="connector bent and clipped" /></p>

<p>Here below, the crimping connector has been crimped to the element to re-join the broken element along the nearby element for the other section of the burner. The crimp was done using the large needle-nose pliers in the parts picture earlier above.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-11_400x252.png" alt="heat element repaired" /></p>

<p>After an initial test of the element, we discovered a bright <strong>hot spot</strong> on the element just before the mending point. This was a thermal stress point because a very small section of the element wire was carrying current for both coils of the burner. This would, for sure, be a future fail point of the element if left as was. I did not include a picture of the hot spot at the mending point&ndash;I was focusing on an accomodating solution and forgot to take one.</p>

<p>The hot spot was a problem. I had to find a way to improve the conductivity along this section of element wire.  To fix the hot spot; I carefully fabricated a much larger crimping part, using a much larger standard connector from the kit. I made sure to have the larger part crimp over the smaller part and also crimp the larger connector directly onto the heavy contact point passing through the edge of the element. I had to lift the insulation just a bit to make the connection to the edge of the element. This new crimp part provided the added conductivity needed to prevent the bright hot spot at the mended point. The heavy aluminum has far less resistance than the resistive heating element; This means that the crimped section will run much cooler than the glowing element.</p>

<p>The charcoal colored circular element insulation, around the entire heating element is made from an extremely lightweight Corning ceramic structure. It is very brittle and easy to crumble&ndash;nearly impossible not to fracture as you try to move it even slightly. It reminds me of the material for the tiles on the space shuttle&ndash;but far less quality.</p>

<p>What you see below is the larger crimp part installed over top of the original and also crimped to the solid conductor at the entry point to the element assembly&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-12_400x307.png" alt="heat element repaired with larger connector" /></p>

<p>Afterwards we did a full power test on the element. You can see that it is evenly heated with no noticable hot-spots at the mending point. The mended crimp point is relatively cool compared to the glowing element. It looks great and hopefully will last a long time.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-13_400x232.png" alt="heat element full power on" /></p>

<p>On to the left-side element. It was much easier to find the breakpoint in this element. There was a visual burn mark where it had failed, again, right near the feed conductor at the edge of the heating element assembly.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-14_400x267.png" alt="heat element front-left" /></p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-15_400x267.png" alt="heat element shows fault at burn mark" /></p>

<p>This time, learning from the previous experience, I started with a larger crimping part which was fabicated from one of the larger parts in the crimping connector kit. I crimped the part using the larger needle-nose pliers again to make solid electrical contact.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-16_400x206.png" alt="connector crimp" /></p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-17_400x163.png" alt="connector bent open" /></p>

<p>Notice also that I removed the insulation ring temporarily to provides access towards the edge of the element.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-18_400x267.png" alt="heat element repaired with connector crimped" /></p>

<p>After replacing the insulation ring and performing a successful full-power test, we begin to re-assemble the range.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-19_400x267.png" alt="range top replacing screw" /></p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-20_400x271.png" alt="range top opened" /></p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-22_400x331.png" alt="range top closed" /></p>

<p>With wallet still in-tact and the range installed again into the kitchen; We use the repaired center element on the right-front to heat up lunch.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-25_400x204.png" alt="range top pan with food being heated" /></p>

<p>&hellip;and celebrate success with a hot meal and a great tasting brew from Great Lakes brewery.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-range/range-27_400x267.png" alt="lunchtime meal at table" /></p>

<h2>How much $ did we get paid ??</h2>

<p>There are lots of different ways to look at this. It helps to consider that by saving $320 and spending about an hour to complete the work, we got paid $320 per hour to fix the range. If we had a repair technician do the work it would have cost an additional $80 or so making it $400. Considering all, we might consider that <strong>we got paid $400 per hour cash (take home) to fix our own range, and we learned some new skills</strong>&ndash;what a deal! That&rsquo;s a big win.</p>

<h2>Update - This solution worked for only about 4 weeks!</h2>

<p>It has been 4 weeks and both of the repaired elements have failed again. In hindsight I probably should have chosen a better crimping material, such as a steel clip or short section of a small tight spring to hold the element together. The light gauge aluminum material crimp was probably going through too much thermal stress. Another approach might have been to spot-weld the element instead of using crimping part. A small Arc Stick Welder could be purchased for around $120. That would have probably done the trick.</p>

<h2>Time for a new range</h2>

<p>I decided to forgo further work on the older slide-in and ordered a new range. This time around we picked a slightly upper-model coil type from GE, model JBP35DDWW. I am impressed with this one. It has a much larger oven and some very serious heat capacity on the range-top. It costs less than half the price of the original Fridigair slide-in. The GE outperforms the Frigidair slide in by a long shot. The new unit has 2 3000 watt 8 inch coils on the range top. The direct coil contact heat elements transfer heat far better than the glass top on the earlier unit. The new coil range cooks far more quickly than the glass top range. If a burner goes out, it costs only $20 to $30 dollars to replace it. I will never buy a glass top range again&ndash;they are inferior over-priced junk!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Driving down the street at night and wondering why I can&rsquo;t see the road the way I used to be able to. Are my headlamps on?</strong></p>

<p>I am posting this information with hope that it might help others who are experiencing the same problem I had. If you find it of good use, please drop me an email to let me know. Please read the disclaimer at the bottom of this document.</p>

<p>Does your headlamp lens look cloudy and dull&ndash;like this one? :)
<img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-headlamp-lens/celica-lens-cloudy_400x267.png" alt="cloudy headlamp lens" /></p>

<h2>Forward</h2>

<p>In this article we illustrate a solution for the embedded dirt, grime, and chemical residue, that builds up on the surface of the acrylic headlamp lens.</p>

<h2>Problem described:</h2>

<p>The headlamp lens on my daughters 2000 Celica GTS has been looking very cloud for a few years now. It has become rather frustrating because it interfers with the performance of the headlamps on the car. The headlamp system on the Celica is top-notch when it is working properly. The problem is that the clouded headlamp diffuses the light and reduces the illuminating distance of the headlamp system&ndash;this impedes night driving and can be unsafe. It is also very frustrating to look at after cleaning and waxing the otherwise great looking car. It stands out like a black eye on the poor little Celica&ndash;we gotta fix it. :(</p>

<p>Upon close inspection, it appears the the clouding of the lens is mostly, if not entirely, on the outside surface of the lens.</p>

<h2>Possible solutions:</h2>

<p>The guy at AutoZone suggested to my daughter that she try a lens repair kit. The kit is from Turtle Wax, and is called &ldquo;Headlight Lens Restorer&rdquo;. It costs about $10.00. She came to visit this weekend and brought the kit with her. We decided to give it a try. I must say I was a little skeptical at first, but afterwards I was totally blown away by the results.</p>

<h2>Repairing the lens</h2>

<p>Here are the steps we went through to restore the headlight lenses, both of them, on the Celica. It was very easy and took only a few minutes&hellip;</p>

<p>Below is the Turtle Wax kit my daughter brought home from AutoZone.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-headlamp-lens/turtle-wax-lens-repair-kit_400x514.png" alt="2000 Celica GTS rear view" /></p>

<p>Below is a shot of the Celica GTS, looking just great from the rear.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-headlamp-lens/celica-gts-2000_400x250.png" alt="2000 Celica GTS rear view" /></p>

<p>But low and behold, the view from the front shows the ugly, dull, headlamp on the passenger side.</p>

<p><a href="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-headlamp-lens/celica-lens-cloudy_400x267.png">cloudy headlamp lens</a></p>

<p>Following the instructions, we tape off the body surrounding the headlamp to prevent any damage to the paint on the vehicle.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-headlamp-lens/taped-celica-lens_400x247.png" alt="tape off the lens" /></p>

<p>Following the instructions, and using an old towel, we first try to use the white polishing agent provided in the kit. With just a bit of polishing effort, the grime embedded into the lens surface starts to immediately show up on the towel&ndash;wow great!</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-headlamp-lens/apply-polishing-agent_400x298.png" alt="applying headlight lens polishing agent" /></p>

<p>Afterwards we applied the acrylic sealer provided in the kit using the small application cloth provided. The headlamp lens looks like new again. It was simply a remarkable transformation&ndash;like NEW again! Crystal CLEAR! It has not looked this great since we purchased the car. My daugher and I are both <strong>amazed</strong> at the results!</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-headlamp-lens/lens-looking-great_400x302.png" alt="clear headlamp lens" /></p>

<p>&hellip;and now we have a great looking front view of the Celca GTS!</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-headlamp-lens/celica-front-repaired-lens_400x269.png" alt="2000 Celica GTS front view" /></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Although the kit came with some additional products for sanding out and refinishing the headlamp lens, the only parts of the kit we used was the white polishing and cleaning agent and the acrylic sealant towelette. I highly recomment this product. It is well worth $10.00.</p>

<p>BTW&ndash;A single new headlamp lens for the 2000 Celica GTS will run you about $270 from the dealer.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.virt-manager.org/">Virtual Machine Manager</a> application (virt-manager) is a desktop user interface for managing virtual machines.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://virt.kernelnewbies.org/MacVTap">MacVTap Wiki</a> over at <a href="http://virt.kernelnewbies.org/">kernelnewbies website</a> has some very useful information on the benefits of the KVM MacVTap device driver.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://virt.kernelnewbies.org/">kernelnewbies website</a> has a considerable amount of information on Linux virtualization.</p>

<p>Another good option for a virtualization server is CentOS. Nixcraft has a very good article about setting up a <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/centos-rhel-linux-kvm-virtulization-tutorial/">CentOS KVM virtualization server</a>. They are using CentOS v5.3.</p>

<p>There is a great <a href="http://itscblog.tamu.edu/startup-guide-for-kvm-on-centos-6/">Startup guide for KVM</a> with CentOS on ITSC blog. But this time it is the later CentOS 6.0 version and they are setting up a headless server. They add virt-manager to the headless server and run it remotely from a seperate management host&ndash;very useful.</p>

    <updated>2013-04-05T02:33:28-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/blog/2013/04/05/fedora-virtualization-server</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here we will describe how to set up Fedora 18 with KVM as a virtualization server and then use <strong>virt-manager</strong> to locally manage the VMs and other virtual resources.</p>

<p>Also we will describe how to set up a management host which would be used to remotely manage the Fedora virtualization server and hypervisor through ssh and virt-manager. The management host could be desktop system with Fedora installed on it.</p>

<h2>What you will need</h2>

<p>For the Fedora virtualization server, something like a  Cicso UCS would be great if you can spare $15K or so.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-fedora-kvm/cisco-ucs-front-view_400x39.png" alt="cicso ucs server" /></p>

<p>Moving more towards the mid-range budget minded, an older Dell 2950 server might be just the ticket&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-fedora-kvm/dell-2950-single_400x80.png" alt="dell server" /></p>

<p>On the lower-end budget, a decent 64 bit multicore <strong>desktop system</strong> would work just fine as well.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A reliable server or desktop system with enough resources to accomodate the VMs you plan to create and run in the system.</p></li>
<li><p>An optional additional system to use as a client for management of the Fedora virtualization server, that is if you want to manage the Fedora virt server from a remote system.</p></li>
<li><p>A Fedora 18 64-bit Gnome desktop installation CD (or USB). You can get the raw image for the installation from the Fedora website. It is totally free to use and scale as you wish.</p></li>
<li><p>Some patience and willingness to learn some new skills.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Step 1 - Install Fedora into the server (10 minutes)</h2>

<p>Perform a Fedora 18 64-bit Gnome Desktop intallation to the server hardware of choice. In my most recent case I installed Fedora 18 into a Dell 2950 with 8GB RAM and 170 GB of usable RAID storage&ndash;the perfect server for what I was needing to do at the time.</p>

<p>Boot the installation media in the server and proceed to install it using the installation prompt provided. It will eventually stop at the partioning tool. Make sure to affirm that you want to review the partioning during the installation. This will give you the chance to make some adjustments in the sizes and number of the partitions allotted to the Fedora installation process.</p>

<p>During installation, change the partitioning storage volumes. The installer default storage arrangement suggests most storage will be committed to &ldquo;/home&rdquo;. The problem with this is that KVM/QEMU images, by default, are created at &ldquo;/var/lib/libvirt/images/.&rdquo;. If you plan to have lots of virtual machine images and use the standard suggested partitioning, then it will be likely you will run out of space on the filesystem root partition &ldquo;/&rdquo; as you add more and more virtual machines.</p>

<p>There are a number options we can do to resolve the storage issue, while in the partitioning tool:</p>

<ol>
<li>We can rearrange the partitioning to provide a dedicated additional partition and assign mount point for &ldquo;/var/lib/libvirt/&rdquo; to this partition. -or-</li>
<li>We can simply rearrange the standard partitioning such that most of the storage in at filesystem root &ldquo;/&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;/home&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>


<p>I normally choose the latter of these two choices and commit most of the available storage to root filesystem (/). I reduce the /home partition to 30GB or so. There are other options as well, but we won&rsquo;t get into them here.</p>

<p>After adjusting the partitioning as necessary, follow the Fedora CD live image installation process through to completion</p>

<h2>Step 2 - Configure the Fedora Desktop (3 minutes)</h2>

<p>In this section we log into the Fedora system for the first time and perform system configuration tasks.</p>

<p>Log into the Desktop using a display, keyboard, and mouse, attached to the server.</p>

<p>Configure the network to allow for remote management of the system. This requires that we setup a network interface that is not managed by Network Manager. Read on&hellip;</p>

<p>If your host will be static ip, then set that up. Use the network setting on the gnome network settings desktop interface. You can find it in system settings or directly from the network icon on the desktop. Otherwise just use DHCP (automatic settings) as is provided by default.</p>

<p>Now set the host interface to not be managed by network manager. We do this because we want any required interfaces to come up at boot time without having anyone logged into the host. Network manager activates network interfaces for users when they are logged in&ndash;not what we want for the server environment. We want network up and running right from the boot&ndash;even without a user logged in.  We will need to edit the required network start script(s). For example: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-em1. Make sure the following entries are present in the script:</p>

<pre><code>NM_CONTROLLED=no
ONBOOT=yes
</code></pre>

<p>Now enable the &ldquo;non-network-manager&rdquo; traditional networking scripting using the chkconfig utility. This allows network interfaces that are marked with &ldquo;NM_CONTROLLED=no&rdquo; to be able to be managed by the traditional Linux network scripting support.</p>

<pre><code>chkconfig network on
chkconfig network start
</code></pre>

<p>We take the network control away from the Gnome network manager because we don&rsquo;t want to require a desktop user to first login before the Fedora system tries to enable the network connection.</p>

<p>To easily view the runtime daemon configuration, perform the following command:</p>

<pre><code>chkconfig
</code></pre>

<p>Install the ssh server&hellip;this will provide for remote management through virt-manager, ssh, and remote file management through scp. As root, perform the following:</p>

<pre><code>yum install openssh-server
</code></pre>

<p>That should do it. The Fedora system should have the required networking running from boot&ndash;and also when nobody is logged into desktop on the server system. It will also work when users are logged in.</p>

<h2>Step 3 - Completing the Fedora server installation general update of software and installation of KVM virtualization components (~ 5 min).</h2>

<p>These commands can be done locally at the Fedora virtualization server or through ssh access from a remote system.</p>

<p>Perform a general update of the Fedora server. As root, or sudo&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>yum update
</code></pre>

<p>Install the Virtualization group of rpm packages. As root&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>yum groupinstall Virtualization
</code></pre>

<p>Install the libvirt daemon for qemu which provides for creation of KVM guest images on the host. Again, as root, or sudo&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>yum install libvirt-daemon-qemu
</code></pre>

<p>Now we will restart the server to make sure all the required daemon services are running; libvirtd, etc. As root, or sudo&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>init 6
</code></pre>

<h2>Fedora virtualization system management from another host. (optional)</h2>

<p>The Fedora server can be managed either locally or from a remote host. If you are not managing the server from a remote host, then you can skip this entire step.</p>

<p>For command line access you can use a secure shell</p>

<pre><code>ssh user@host
</code></pre>

<p>For graphical use you can use X forwarding through ssh</p>

<pre><code>ssh -X user@host
</code></pre>

<p>For file management and transfer between hosts you can use secure copy (scp) to transfer files. It is very easy to use and provides secure file transfer.</p>

<p>For example to start the gnome control at the managing system first attach a terminal ssh session with X forwarding:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -X user@host
</code></pre>

<p>Then invoke the control center as follows:</p>

<pre><code>gnome-control-center &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>From there you can adjust various system settings at the remote host including the network, proxy, users, printers, etc.</p>

<h2>Setting up the remote management host to manage the Fedora virtualization server with <strong>virt-manager</strong>. (~5 min)</h2>

<p>If you are <strong>not</strong> using a remote management host, then you can skip this section.</p>

<p>This section assumes that we already have another Fedora or otherwise Linux host setup for management of the system we have outlined above. This host system requires the Virtualization group be already installed at the management host. We specifically need a local instance of virt-manager on the management host that we will use to add a connection to the the Fedora server KVM hypervisor through the libvirt daemon. All commands here are done from the local managing host.</p>

<p>Before we can add a remote hypervisor to virt-manager at the management host we need to make sure that the Fedora virt server has the public key of the management host added to the known hosts for root on Fedora virt server. We must first make sure there is a public/private key pair on the management host where we will run virt-manager. By default the two files are located at ~/.ssh/. and are &ldquo;id_rsa&rdquo;, &ldquo;id_rsa.pub&rdquo;. If they are not present we can generate them very easily using the ssh-keygen utility as follows (accepting defaults):</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa
</code></pre>

<p>If you decide to password (passphrase) protect the private key, you may need to run ssh-agent in order for the authentication to work. I normally do not password protect the private key, so have not yet used ssh-agent. If you are interested see the manpage for ssh-agent for more information on how to use it.</p>

<p>To allow virt-manager to connect to a remote host it is first necessary to add the public key from the management system to the allowed keys on each remote machine running libvirt. To add the public key to the list of allowed keys for the user root@host:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@host
</code></pre>

<p>To start virt-manager and perform virtualization management. On the management host we can use the following command</p>

<pre><code>sudo virt-manager
</code></pre>

<p>Virt-manager can also be started graphically from the search facility in the Fedora Gnome 3 desktop, or added to the favorites menu bar. It will challenge you for your sudo user password before starting.</p>

<p>In the virt-manager interface you will need to add a new connection to the Fedora virt server hypervisor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;virt-manager -> File -> Add Connection&rdquo;.</p>

<p>With the connection to the Fedora 18 virtualization server, we can now create new VMs, clone VMs, add Spice/VNC access to VMs, Delete VMs, manage storage, perform virtual network management, etc.. We can also completely manage, and use, the Fedora virtualization server from the management system&ndash;as briefly outlined in step 3 above.</p>

<p>When creating a network bridge in virt-manager, you may need to disable the spanning tree protocol (STP). Some managed switches will disable the physical port if your host uses STP on them. This is apparently a switch configuration&ndash;I ran into it in a network lab recently.</p>

<h2>Running virt-manager directly on the Fedora virtualization server</h2>

<p>If you are not managing the Fedora virt server from another system, then you will have to log into the server desktop and run virt-manager to perform virtualization management of the local hypervisor (KVM). Of course you will need a keyboard, mouse, and display attached because you will be using the server as a desktop system&ndash;in some cases this may not be feasible. Log into the desktop, open up a gnome-teminal session and enter the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo virt-manager
</code></pre>

<p>When you first start virt-manager it looks rather simple, but don&rsquo;t let that fool you. Virt-manager can perform some heavy lifting; VM management, virtual networking, storage, remote hypervisor management. Upon first start, virt-manager may need to be connected to the local hypervisor. To connect to the local hypervisor, use &ldquo;File -> Add Connection&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Of course you could occasionally manage the Fedora system from afar and occasionally manage it directly at the server. Either way, it&rsquo;s your choice&ndash;very flexible.</p>

<h2>Remote diagnosis - Monitoring IP traffic with wireshark-gnome.</h2>

<p>This section explains how to add wireshark, which allows you to perform detailed network and device analysis, to the Fedora virtualization server. This is critical to have if you need to be able to monitor and analyze network data at the server. The commands shown can be run from the remote management host or directly at the Fedora virtualization server.</p>

<p>Log into the Fedora virt server system with ssh</p>

<pre><code>ssh user@host

su

yum install wireshark-gnome
</code></pre>

<p>Now make sure that the &ldquo;user&rdquo; we want to allow to run wireshark is in the &ldquo;wireshark&rdquo; group.</p>

<pre><code>usermod -a -G wireshark user
</code></pre>

<p>Use X forwarding to start wireshark at the remote host and view/control it at the managing system. &ldquo;user&rdquo; in this case the the same user we provided with the line above.</p>

<pre><code>ssh -X user@host

wireshark &amp;
</code></pre>

<h2>Remote management of the Fedora 18 virtualization server - running desktop applications</h2>

<p>There are lots of great tools to use to manage the Fedora virt server. Anything we run directly at the desktop on the Fedora server can also be run in view from the management host:</p>

<p>Log into remote host using ssh with X forwarding</p>

<pre><code>ssh -X user@host
</code></pre>

<p>The following commands are examples of some of the programs that can be run from afar at the management host.</p>

<pre><code>system-config-network

system-config-printer

gnome-control-center

wireshark-gnome
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using the gnome desktop proxy settings at Fedora server host and need to have the proxy environment variables set properly in a terminal session from the remote management system&ndash;say to run yum commands, or perform a wget; Just invoke a gnome terminal session from the active (ssh -X) session like so:</p>

<pre><code>gnome-terminal
</code></pre>

<h2>Which terminal session you run can make a big difference</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget; When you run a non-X11 ssh session to a remote Linux system you do not get the gnome environment enabled terminal session. You get a somewhat basic terminal session that is void of Gnome specific environment settings. If you want your terminal session to behave as if you were logged into Gnome&ndash;for proxy settings etc., then you need to use gnome-terminal.</p>

<p><strong>My experience with the Fedora 18 virtualization server has been great.</strong>. The Dell 2950 server is performing very well and the stability of the overall system is incredible! Fedora rocks!</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of virt-manager, running at the management host, connected to the Fedora virt server remote hypervisor</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-fedora-kvm/virt-manager_400x269.png" alt="virt-manager remote" /></p>

<p>Here is the entire desktop at the management host. I have wireshark up and running as I monitor traffic from an Elastix PBX running in a VM within the Fedora virt server hypervisor. Click the image for a larger view.</p>

<p><a href="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-fedora-kvm/virt-manager-wireshark_1024x640.png" target="_blank"> <img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-fedora-kvm/virt-manager-wireshark_400x250.png" border="0" alt="Fedora virt server management" /></a></p>

<p>A few points about creating VMs under virt-manager</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you use SPICE for the video connection channel to the VM you will get a very smooth and fast display experience when connecting to the VM (guest OS display). This is far better than the older bandwidth hog VNC. The SPICE protocol provides for highly compressed and accelerated video performance. It greatly reduces the required network bandwidth for remoting the VM to a SPICE client on remote host. In most cases a 1M bit connection is all you need for a perfectly responsive virtual desktop. It works so well that you don&rsquo;t even realize you are running on a remote machine.</p></li>
<li><p>Spice USB forwarding provides the ability to add USB channels to the VM for USB plug-in forwarding on spice client connections. You can connected from a remote host to the VM guest, and then forward a USB device connection at the remote host to the guest VM. To do this you need to add a &ldquo;USB Redirection&rdquo; virtual device to the VM. You need to add as many USB Rediretion devices as you plan to have number of USB devices forwarded to the VM at one time. Each USB device forwarded takes up an available forwarding slot. I have had 10 USB devices forwarded to the VM guest at one time with no problems.</p></li>
<li><p>To take full advantage of KVM virtual devices and Spice, be sure to to add the virtio drivers to the guest VM. linux-kvm.org has <a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/WindowsGuestDrivers/Download_Drivers">virtio drivers</a> for Windows available for free. Many of the modern Linux distibutions come with virtio drivers included, or available in the repositories for the Linux distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>When connecting the VMs to a network, you can use a virtual network device called the <strong>MacVTap</strong>. This is available using point and click with virt-manager. This is similar to a bridge, but easer to setup and use than a bridge. MacVTap is not only easier to use and setup than a bridge, but provides other benefits and more flexibility.</p></li>
<li><p>I typically use a separate network interface for use by the VM guests. The original network interface is used for server management, local users, etc. When creating the VM I typically use a MacVTAP to the dedicated NIC.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s all for now. Have fun with your new virtualization server!</p>

    <id>http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/blog/2013/04/04/auto-repair-fixing-the-bmw-325-faulty-rear-tail-light</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am posting this information with hope that it might help others who are experiencing the same problem I am having with the E46 tail light assembly. If you find it of good use, please drop me an email to let me know. Please read the disclaimer at the bottom of this document.</p>

<p>Can you spot the problem in this rear tail light connector?</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-e46/show_bad_lead_400x300.jpg" alt="rear light assembly" /></p>

<h3>Forward</h3>

<p>My 18 year old son has been having problems with his 2001 BMW 325i. The body style is E46. The right tail light is not working properly. It is blinking too fast and does not seem to have enough illumination. It recently stopped working at all. I told him not to drive it until we had it repaired, so of course he has been quite anxious to get back to driving his car—he loves his BMW. He has been avoiding driving the “spare” family van, a rusty 94 Mercury Villager with a broken heater, broken AC, and 198,000 miles on it—can you blame him? Always up for a challenge and also for saving a buck or two, I decided to take a crack at fixing the BMW&hellip; :)</p>

<h3>Problem described:</h3>

<p>The right rear directional indicator, or turn signal, is very dim and flashes too quickly. Other lights within the same assembly are also very dim. The car keeps indicating a directional light warning on the dash panel. This problem went on for a couple of weeks and now, as of very recently, it has stopped working completely.</p>

<h3>Possible solutions:</h3>

<p>My first thought was that the problem might be with the light bulbs, so they were all checked and were found to be working perfectly. Next thought was that the problem could be a blown fuse. We checked the fuses, and they were ok as well. I started looking into replacement of the relay mechanism. The relay seems to be difficult to get to, so I went to the web for some information.</p>

<p>While searching around for information on the relay I was able to find out that there is a <a href="http://forum.e46fanatics.com/showthread.php?t=533309&amp;highlight=melted+tail+light">documented problem</a> in the way the light assembly has been designed for this car. Although I am grateful for the author&rsquo;s post on this, I believe this solution looks far more complicated than it needs to be. I solved it instead using one single wire connection back into the BMW 325i E46 wire harness.</p>

<p>The design problem appears to be in the material BMW chose for the ground return circuit in the tail light assembly, stamped steel sheathing. This material can not handle the ground return current. It basically gets too hot and eventually fries out at the thinnest point (least conductive) which happens to be within the connector contact area. I would not be suprised to find out that other BMW body styles have the same problem assuming that the folks at BMW might be using similar material selections on other vehicles.</p>

<h3>Problem solved:</h3>

<p>The solution I chose was to remove the ground return path from the connector and provide a much more conductive path using an external piece of 12 gauge stranded copper wire pulled from an old AC cord. Nothing beats copper wire for moving electrons. Ok, perhaps a super-conductor, but we aren&rsquo;t going there today :)</p>

<p>The repair job took me about 40 minutes or so to complete&ndash;it took me far longer to write this article. The lights on the vehicle are now working perfectly!</p>

<h3>Step by step what I did to solve the problem:</h3>

<p>Below is a view of the 2001 BMW 325i E46 rear light assembly, once it has been removed from the trunk area.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-e46/e46_right_rear_light_assembly_400x300.jpg" alt="rear light assembly" /></p>

<p>Notice the burnt-out conductor below. The third conductor from the right of the connector. It has basically melted and corroded away from the intense heat. &ndash;very poor choice of material in this case—shame on BMW for that one.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-e46/show_bad_lead_400x300.jpg" alt="rear light assembly" /></p>

<p>Below I have cut the bad conductor from the assembly using a pair of snub-nose wire clippers. You don&rsquo;t want to leave the old unattached conductor in the assembly, it could short out one of the other conductors if it came loose.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-e46/cut_bad_lead_400x300.jpg" alt="rear light assembly" /></p>

<p>Below I have removed the bad conductor from the connector assembly. I just pull it out from the bottom using a pair of needle-nose pliers. Notice also that I have raised and clipped the strip at the thicker area to ready it for a new slide-on connector&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-e46/removed_lead_400x300.jpg" alt="rear light assembly" /></p>

<p>You will need some tooling for performing electircal crimping. This is very inexepensive equipment and can be found at your local hardware, electrical, or builders supply store, such as Lowes or Home Depot. I just happen to have this stuff in my repair box for situations like this. Below is a picture of the tooling I used for this job. There is also DELL laptop with mouse in the picture, but you won&rsquo;t need either of those for this job. :)</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-e46/termination-kit_400x533.jpg" alt="rear light assembly" /></p>

<p>Below I have used the crimping tool and a blue slide-on connector to attached a new ground lead to the thicker, more conductive part of the metal strip. The unit is now ready to take back and install into the vehicle. If you do this you must make sure that the wire you pick is of greater current carrying capacity than what is found in the wiring harness in the car. In my case I used 12 gauge stranded copper wire which is a considerable improvement in conductivity than to what BMW is using in the wire harness. 14 gauge stranded copper would be great also. I would not go any smaller than 14 gauge. This piece of 12 gauge was cut and pulled from an old extension cord lying around the house.</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-e46/lead_attached_400x300.jpg" alt="rear light assembly" /></p>

<p>Now we are ready to install the light assembly unit back into the vehicle. Make sure all of the bulbs are inserted back into the assembly and take it back to the trunk of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Below is the unit sitting in the trunk and connected to the wire-harness. You&rsquo;ll have to excuse the visible junk in the trunk—my son is not very particular about his car trunk. As you can see, I have clipped the brown ground lead from the vehicle&rsquo;s wire harness and connected my green ground wire to it using another blue crimping connector from the connector set above. The crimp tooling and connectors are great to work with; Simple to use, effective, and quick!</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-e46/connection_complete_400x300.jpg" alt="rear light assembly" /></p>

<p>Next we snapped the light assembly back into position within the trunk and checked out the lights. Hooray! Everything is now working perfectly. Lights are as bright and snappy as the day the vehicle was purchased. The light warning is no longer appearing at the dash board. My son can now drive his car again! He&rsquo;s a happy camper and we are not out the $ hundreds it would have probably cost us to deal with the BMW service center.</p>

<p>&hellip;As a precautionary measure I checked the left rear light assembly for the same problem. The materials and connectors are the same on the left side, but I did not see any sign of a problem on that side. For now, I decided to leave the left side alone. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll be dealing with the left side in the future. :)</p>

<p>A few other things we have done at home with this BMW 325i E46 since we purchased it as a used vehicle a few years back:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Changed break shoes and brake wear sensors front and back—pretty easy task and saved us a bundle.</p></li>
<li><p>Performed regular oil and filter change.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a leaking O-ring on the top radiator hose.</p></li>
<li><p>Changed serpentine belt on front of the engine—that one was fun—NOT!</p></li>
<li><p>Front end alignment—yes we can do that also without the use of any expensive equipment!</p></li>
<li><p>Changed the rear drivers-side window drive motor.</p></li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am posting this information with hope that it might help others who are interested in improving their home and looking for a great way to document and move forward with a plan for home improvement. If you find this document useful, then please drop me an email to let me know. Please read the disclaimer at the bottom of this document. Update: Please note that <strong>LibreCAD was originally called QCAD</strong>.</p>

<p>Below is a basement home improvement design in LibreCAD</p>

<p><img src="http://runlevel-6.github.io/runlevel-6/images-librecad/qcad_basement_plan_400x298.png" alt="qcad design graphic" /></p>

<h3>Forward</h3>

<p>We have been living in our home for several years now. Recently my wife and I have been talking about doing some improvements in the basement. We decided that finishing part of the basement would provide an increase in living space and also provide a great way to relax and spend time with our family and friends.</p>

<h3>Creating a Detailed Drawing</h3>

<p>By creating a detailed drawing we are able to discuss and consider more details and and to easily modify the plan while we make changes. The drawing is a very detailed model that allows you to visualize how the finished project will eventually look. It forces you to think about and deal with many of the details of the project before getting started with any materials. Once you create a scaled drawing can more easily plan for the obstacles and limitations that you have in the existing area. Things like floor drains, plumbing pipes, heating ducts, furnace, windows, hot water tank, electrical breaker box, and other details must be carefully worked into the plan.  A detailed drawing gives you confidence in what you are planning to do.</p>

<h3>Searching for a CAD software package:</h3>

<p>Some CAD software tools are very time consuming to learn. They can also be very expensive, running into the $thousands for a single user license. The first place I searched for a CAD package was in the package manager on my Ubuntu Linux system. I was looking for something that was easy to learn and provided enough power to get the job done. I found LibreCAD, an open source CAD package which is licensed under the GPL. What a gem this software package turned out to be. It is rock solid and provides all of the functionality I need to produce a quality scale drawing.</p>

<h3>Creating the design drawing:</h3>

<p>The first thing I did in LibreCAD was to set the default units of measurement and length for the drawing. I set units to inches and length to inches with a precision of 1/2”. You can work in just about any units and precision you&rsquo;d like of course. I then carefully documented where everything was in the basement. This involved measuring the foundation walls, identifying and drawing all of the ductwork, beams, support posts, plumbing fixtures, service interfaces for plumbing, water, and electrical fixtures. These items were grouped and placed in various layers of the drawing. I then added the improvements into the design, carefully working around everything that was already there. It took some time, but allowed me to think through many of the details that may have been missed without going through the drawing, or visual modeling, process.</p>

<h3>Screen shots of LibreCAD in action</h3>

<p>Below is LibreCAD up and running with the basement plan opened. You can see that I have created layers in the drawing which are identified in the rightmost pane. Each layer can be made visible or invisible in the drawing. Different line attributes can be assigned for each layer. Although the drawing looks complicated, it was actually quite easy to create after spending some time learning LibreCAD.</p>

<p>LibreCAD does a great job at exporting graphics to postscript format. You can easily view the output file in Adobe acrobat or an open source document viewer. It supports output to standard paper sizes including very large paper formats used for plotters. Below is an example of the same drawing in print preview ready to be exported to post script or printed directly.</p>

<h3>An example librecad design file</h3>

<p>If you would like an example copy of a LibreCAD .dxf basement plan, you can download it from my website here: <A HREF="/download/basement_plan.dxf">basement_plan.dxf</A></p>

<p>Once you spend some time with LibreCAD I think you will agree; This is a great tool to have for home improvement planning. It also works great for other 2D CAD applications, such as in designing mechanical parts for fabrication. I have also used it for design work on some woodworking projects.</p>
