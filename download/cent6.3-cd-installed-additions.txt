Server Hardware:
A dedicated rack server or a typical PC with 2 (or more) network adapters.
AMD or Intel 64-bit single or multi-core processor.
Hard drive with ample capacity (20GB or greater recommended)

Install Cent 6.3 from Live CD.
Use an official mirror to get the install media .iso file which can be
found here: http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/6/isos/x86_64/

Use the file:"CentOS-6.3-x86_64-liveCD.iso".  It is a 692 MB CD image and
comes with a very stable and easy to use Gnome 2.2 level desktop. It
provides what I believe is a great set of needed software components as
a good start for the gatekeeper system, without lots of unnecessary
packages.

Do not use the DVD version. It is way too bloated with KDE components.

Do not use the "minimal" version unless you are planning to run a headless
server. In that case some minor changes to the instructions may need
to be made.
The "minimal" version has no X11 or desktop by default. These components
can be added later, but this document does not cover how to add a desktop
interface to a "minimal" install.

Setup initial "zadmin" administrative account with password. Use another
account name for administration if you wish and modify instructions
accordingly wherever "zadmin" is mentioned.

The rpmforge repository is used to add codecs for various media formats.
It is also used to acquire additional components and applications, such
as LibreOffice components.

Acquire the rpmforge repository install for x86_64
  http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/
  rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el6.rf.x86_64.rpm

Open terminal and su to root (su). Run the following...

Add rpmforge public key and the corresponding repository:
	rpm --import http://apt.sw.be/RPM-GPG-KEY.dag.txt
	rpm -ivh rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el6.rf.x86_64.rpm

Add some additional optional packages to improve the desktop experience:
	yum install htop
	yum install yum-plugin-priorities
	yum install compat-libstdc++-33 libdvdcss libdvdread libdvdplay \
	libdvdnav lsdvd libquicktime
	yum install flash-plugin mplayerplug-in mplayer mplayer-gui \
	gstreamer-ffmpeg gstreamer-plugins-bad gstreamer-plugins-ugly

Get these mplayer codecs from
http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/codecs/
...Install them using the rpm as follows.

	rpm -ivh mplayer-codecs-20061022-1.x86_64.rpm 
	rpm -ivh mplayer-codecs-extra-20061022-1.x86_64.rpm 

Adjust repo priorities by editing the yum repo configuration files
in /etc/yum.repos.d/.

Follow example at
http://wiki.centos.org/PackageManagement/Yum/Priorities
In general set base CentOS repository priorities at 1 using an entry in
each repository "priority=1". Others can be left as is and will default
to lowest priority "99" without a specific "priority= " entry. This will
prevent unwanted updates from repositories overwriting package levels
of higher priority repositories when running the software updates or
the update manager (yum update). The general idea here is to allow
other repositories for additional component installs but hold back
unwanted updates from those repositories on common components
with the CENTos primary repositories.

	vim CentOS-Base.repo 
	vim CentOS-Debuginfo.repo 
	vim CentOS-Media.repo 
	vim CentOS-Vault.repo

Perform a general update with the repo priorities set properly as described
above.
	yum update

Install some more packages to help make the gatkeeper desktop experience
a fully usable system...

	yum install icedtea-web
	yum install rhythmbox
	yum install libreoffice-writer libreoffice-draw libreoffice-calc
	yum install libreoffice-impress libreoffice-emailmerge
	yum install libreoffice-graphicfilter

	yum install vim-X11
	yum install system-config-printer
	yum install gnome-system-log
	yum install xsane
	yum install wireshark-gnome
	
************************************************************
*********** packages for HP print and scan systems *********

For HP branded printers, scanners, PSCs, MFPs etc. you will need to install
hplib as follows. I have a HP M1536dnf laser MFP so will need hplip:

	yum install hplip

	After installing hplip, run system-config-printer to add the hp
	printer. Add new printer...
		gatekeeper
		/printers/HP_LaserJet_M1536dnf_MFP

	..follow wizard and select HP LaserJet "M1522nf MFP Foomatic" driver
	since Cent 6.3 does not yet carry the specific ppd for the M1536dnf
	hardware.  This driver is a compromise but seems to work properly.
	The proper driver is in the latest hplip from hp.com, but requires
	dependencies provided in a later version of Linux, such as Fedora 17.
	Therefore, it should eventually be available in a later version of
	CentOS.

Note: Downloaded newer hplip from hp website for Redhat Enterprise 6.0 which is
binary compatible with CentOS 6.3. AND contains updates to support the
HP LaserJet M1536dnf.

	http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/install_wizard/index.html

Followed the wizard to download the latest rpm file which is referenced below.
	hplip-3.12.11_rhel-6.0.x86_64.rpm

Ran a rpm "test" install to determine if there are any problems up front:

	rpm -i --test hplip-3.12.11_rhel-6.0.x86_64.rpm

...Test output produced many file conflicts with existing installed hp* parts.
Removed older hplip that were installed previously: hplip, hpijs, hplip-common,
(version 3.10.9-3). As follows below:

	yum remove hplip

	yum remove hpijs

	yum remove hplip-common
		(This also removed dependency hplip-libs)

Yum install the newer downloaded hplip .rpm which is a full hplip install and
apparently includes the hplip, hpijs, hplip-common, and hplip-libs.

	yum install ./hplip-3.12.11_rhel-6.0.x86_64.rpm


**********************************************************************
******* Packages needed specifically for gatekeeper services *********

	yum install dhcp
	yum install samba
	yum install bind bind-libs bind-utils


**********************************************************************
******** Save history and continue with setup instructions ***********

Save history file for safe keeping and, if necessary, to review later:
	history >history_yyyy-mm-dd.txt

This completes installation of packages. Continue with setup instructions
found in the file "gatekeeper.setup.readme.txt"
