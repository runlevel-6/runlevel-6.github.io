<p>The CentOS KVM/Qemu hypervisor can be setup in short order and provides all of the tools necessary to support enterprise class virtualization. Create and manage VMs and virtual networks. We begin with a quick 5 minute install of CentOS minimal. Then add virtualization packages and desired utilities with some follow-on configuration activities. It installs and sets up quickly into just about any modern virt-capable host hardware you can imagine. <strong>From enterprise grade servers, to desktop, or even laptop systems.</strong> I have implemented it many times in both CentOS 6 and CentOS 7. I like the new systemd and graphical firewall-config in CentOS 7.</p>

<p>The hypervisor host can be used for research, development, and/or production systems. It provides <strong>graphical management</strong> of virtual machines, virtual networking, and other related resources. It can be easily managed remotely from Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X desktops using a graphical program called
<a href="http://virt-manager.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Machine Manager</a>, invoked simply as &ldquo;virt-manager&rdquo;. Alternatively, command line or scripted management is also possible using a powerful <a href="http://libvirt.org/" target="_blank">libvirt</a>-based program called <a href="http://libvirt.org/virshcmdref.html" target="_blank">Virsh</a>, invoked simply as &ldquo;virsh&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The hypervisor can also be used as a OS provisioning platform for <strong>virtual desktop interface (VDI)</strong> using accelerated
<a href="http://www.spice-space.org/" target="_blank">Spice</a>
or standard common VNC. The Spice protocol and tools provide a very responsive desktop experience delivered to client from VM.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>After a night of heavy rain we have an inch of water in the drivers-side interior footwell!</strong></p>

<p>I am posting this information with hope that it might help others who are experiencing the same problem I had. If you find it of good use, please drop me an email. Please read the disclaimer at the bottom of this document.</p>

<p>The 2007 Saab 93 door leak root cause. A torn foam-panel interior door seal.</p>

<p><img src="/images-saab/5-torn-foam-seal.png" alt="Saab 93" /></p>

<h2>Forward</h2>

<p>In this article we illustrate a solution for a leaking interior door panel on a 2007 Saab 93 2.0t that was discovered in November of 2012.</p>

<h2>Problem described:</h2>

<p>We have had water leaking in on the driver&rsquo;s side for several months, but only after a very heavy rain. On two occasions we had more than an inch of water accumulate!</p>

<h2>Investigation</h2>

<p>I ran a garden hose on the drivers side window for about 2 or 3 minutes and noticed that water was leaking into the interior at the very bottom of the plastic panel attached to the drivers door. The body door seal actually prevents the water from exiting at the bottom of the door opening so it leaks into the cabin and runs onto the carpet into the drivers foot area.</p>

<p>To investigate the root cause, I carefully separated the door panel from the door frame along the lower part of the door. I noticed that the foam seal panel inside the door was damaged, torn up and not connected (adhered to the metal door frame) as it should have been.</p>

<h2>When did the damage occur? At the service dealer 2 years before!</h2>

<p>This got me wondering, since we purchased the car used but still under factory warranty at the time it was purchased. I called the dealer service who confirmed that the car had service performed on the drivers door two years back to replace the window actuator. Apparently the service technician or mechanic, during replacement of the window actuator, had torn up the interior door seal and not bothered to replace or repair it properly. This interior door seal is a thin closed cell foam panel that tears easily when servicing the door mechanics. The panel is adhered to the lower part of the inside of the door and works to keep water moving towards the outside of the door cavity and properly through the drain holes at the bottom of the door.</p>

<p>The attending service manager claimed that the work on the door actuator was guaranteed for 1 year, so the fact that the interior door seal was damaged during that process is past due and there is nothing they can do about it&ndash;even though THEY damaged it in 2010. There was absolutely no way I could tell that the work was substandard without removing the door panel to see it inside the door assembly. So much for professional service and standing by your work. That will be the last time that service dealer gets my business.</p>

<h2>Lesson for service done on a door</h2>

<p>So to make a long story short: If you have ever had work done on the inside of a Saab door, it is imperative that the foam panel seal within the door assembly not be breached. If the seal is not attached properly or is damaged or torn in the repair process you may end up with a door that leaks into the cabin during heavy rains.</p>

<p>Perhaps after service door repairs, a good test at home would be to spray water on the door window for about 15 or 20 minutes to test the seal and make sure the service technician got the seal set up properly. Of course this could be done at the service dealer as part of the repair process to make sure the door handles water properly after service.</p>

<h2>Saab design issue?</h2>

<p>Looking at the Saab door design closely, it is clearly evident that the windows seam at the top of the door is located directly above the lower part of the interior door panel instead of the lower part of the door assembly. This means that any water entering the door-window seam and falling straight down will strike the foam panel and interior parts of the door before finding its way back to the door well drain holes. This particular choice of design makes it imperative that the foam door panel not be breached. I am not sure if this situation occurs in other sporty cars, like the Saab, which tend to have a tapered wider stance at the base of the vehicle when viewed from the front or back of the car. This does help make the car look more appealing and perhaps improves handling by distributing more mass at the base of the car&ndash;a lower center of gravity.</p>

<h2>Repair or replace the part?</h2>

<p>A new foam seal is ~$140 (USD). That is an insane amount of money for a simple piece of foam&ndash;typical service part highway robbery. I will take a stab at fixing it myself. I will use rubberized sealant and transparent box tape. It won&rsquo;t look great, but who cares because the repair work will only be visible if you remove the interior door panel. If I <strong>ever</strong> have to tear out the panel for future repair work on a windows actuator I will consider buying a new foam panel&ndash;but not until then.</p>

<h2>Repairing the foam seal.</h2>

<p>Here are the steps I went through to repair the foam seal in the door. It was very easy and took only a few minutes&hellip;</p>

<p>First we heat the door handle with a hair dryer. We want to get the plastic hot so it can flex more easily.</p>

<p><img src="/images-saab/1-heating-door-handle.png" alt="heating up the door handle" /></p>

<p>After the door handle has been warmed up, we can gently pull and easily snap off the plastic door handle cover.</p>

<p><img src="/images-saab/2-door-handle-cover-removed.png" alt="door handle plastic cover removed" /></p>

<p>Now we must remove two torx bolts which hold the door handle to the door frame.</p>

<p><img src="/images-saab/3-star-driver-upper-handle.png" alt="door panel upper torx" /></p>

<p><img src="/images-saab/4-star-driver-lower-handle.png" alt="door panel lower torx" /></p>

<p>We then gently snap the door panel away and lift it gently to detach it from the door frame. We must be careful with the plastic snaps. The door panel remains loosely attached near the door lever. We can now inspect the the torn foam door seal.</p>

<p><img src="/images-saab/5-torn-foam-seal.png" alt="torn interior door seal" /></p>

<p>Lifting the lower section of the torn foam seal exposes the interior cavity of the door. This is where the water is coming from. The water runs along the torn foam panel and drops onto the interior door panel. From there it enters the cabin.</p>

<p><img src="/images-saab/6-leak-point.png" alt="inner door cavity exposed" /></p>

<p>We carefully use the rubberized sealant to repair the tear in the foam seal. We add quality transparent box tape to further mend any tears and spread the sealant across the tearing. It does not look like new, but it works just fine. The unsightly repair work will be covered completely when the interior door panel is snapped back into position.</p>

<p><img src="/images-saab/7-repaired-foam-seal.png" alt="repaired door seal" /></p>

<p>Afterwards, a lengthy garden hose test reveals that the repair work did the job! The door no longer leaks into the interior of the cabin.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>We successfully repaired the leaking door on the 2007 Saab 93 2.0t. The work took about one hour and we spent about $5. We saved at least $140 in the process and learned a few things along the way. All in all it was a big win-win. <strong>That is $5 and one hour of fussing around!</strong></p>

<p>The solution has worked flawlessly for 18 months, including winter and now several torrential spring rains. We still have the option to replace the foam seal whenever we want to endure the $140 cost. I might consider, instead of cheap flimsy foam, using a custom fit piece of durable 4 or 6 mil plastic visquene.</p>

<p>If we had the service dealer fix it, we would have spent $140 for the part, and at least $90 for the labor. On top of that we would had to drive to the service dealer twice resulting in 2 hours of travel time&ndash;the dealer is 30 minutes away from my home. <strong>That is $230 and 2 hours of our time and travel costs.</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My wife and I had been living in our home, with children, for a number of years and decided it was time for general improvement of the basement. The basement was basically roughed-in but nothing was done beyond what was required for the basic requirements to satisfy the building code. It was not a living area for our home and we wanted to create a living area for our family to enjoy.</p>

<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>After much careful thought, I decided to proceed with the project on my own. I had some home construction experience, from many years back, working with my dad as part of his construction company, Equity Builders, in Lorain, Ohio. My father was an exceptional carpenter and I gained a great appreciation of carpentry and general contracting working with him. I also have an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering&ndash;so the electrical elements of the project came along reasonably easily for me as did the general construction. I did have to do some research on building and electrical codes to make sure everything I was doing would be within the limits of building codes in my area.</p>

<p>The advantages of DIY include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Saving a considerable amount of money</li>
<li>Ability to provide a great job for my two sons to learn and earn money.</li>
<li>Everyone learning lots of new concepts and skills</li>
<li>Remaining in complete control of the job along the way</li>
</ul>


<p>The disadvantages of DIY:</p>

<ul>
<li>Taking more time to complete the project</li>
<li>Spending a few hundred, or so, hours of my time in the basement instead of doing other things</li>
</ul>


<h3>Warning&hellip;</h3>

<p>If you decide to try a basement improvement project on your own make sure you do enough research to understand what you are getting into. Find some experienced people to talk with about the project if you do not have enough experience yourself. Plan the project in phases and celebrate the completion of each phase. If you are unsure about anything you are doing, then get some help. It can be very costly to have to tear something apart because it was not built properly. There are also many dangers that you will encounter in the building process&ndash;power tools, adhesives, paints, electrical distribution components, etc.. The risk of getting seriously hurt goes up dramatically if you don&rsquo;t know what you are doing. Most importantly you want to end up with a safe living environment when you are done&ndash;so pay close attention to building, electrical, and plumbing codes&ndash;think seriously about these and don&rsquo;t be afraid to spend some extra money to make sure the new living environment is safe.</p>

<p>If you do not have experience consider doing some smaller jobs first, then gradually working your way up. Perhaps even helping a professional complete a job, as a part time learning experice. You can offer your help for less, as a means to gain valuable part time on-the-job experience.</p>

<h3>Site Considerations</h3>

<p>When we had our home built, we specified deeper 13 course block basement with the thought that we might eventually improve the basement into a living area. The distance from basement floor to upper level exposed floor joists is about 8 &frac12; feet. Having the deeper basement allowed enough room to build soffits and ceiling into the basement yet provide for a generous amount of head room. The cost of the additional row of block for the basement, at the time the home was built, was around $400&ndash;a worthwhile investment. The basement has a generous amount of open floor space free from utilites above it. It is very dry and we have never had any water issues. The home is built on one of the higher level lots in the development.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>To get the plan started I created a drawing using a CAD tool. I picked an open source tool called LibreCAD to do the drawing. I spent several weeks just drawing, correcting, sketching, and planning what improvements would be made and how to accomplish the task. My original drawings had a small kitchen included, but that was scaled back because of space and cost concerns. Once we had an aggreable plan, I procrastinated for a few months, then began doing the work. I have done most everything so far, with some occasional help from a few of my friends on some of the larger and/or heavier tasks&ndash;such as the drywall finishing. I also had my 15 year old son help me, who learned many skills while doing so. I learned quite a bit also, and continue to learn as I work to complete the project. My older son is also helping me now, when he can, and is also learning much about building.</p>

<h3>Proceeding to build</h3>

<p>With the improvement plan drawing complete, we now have the confidence needed to move forward. We are now in the build phase of the project. We are working the project in phases and decided to leave the last phase, the bathroom, for a later time&ndash;much later. Work has not been moving as quickly as I originally expected but we are making steady progress&ndash;it is a rather large project for one person. It has become a regular part-time weekend job. I am doing most of the work on my own with some help occasionally from my two sons.</p>

<p>Below is the framing work for the first build which divided the basement into entertainment and utility space.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/IMG_2243_400x267.png" alt="furnace room" /></p>

<p>The plan calls for more electrical capacity in the basement&ndash;a lot more. The main panel is nearly out of slots. Here I have added a side-car distribution panel for the finished side of the basement. It will carry the 240V baseboard heater load, wall outlets, and light utilities for the finished side of the basement.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/distribution-side-car_400x267.png" alt="furnace room" /></p>

<p>The side-car distribution is operational. I have a bit more work to do on it. I still need to tie the romex down with some staples and complete the layout document sheet on the inside of the door.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/distribution-side-car-2_400x267.png" alt="furnace room" /></p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/distribution-side-car-3_400x267.png" alt="furnace room" /></p>

<p>Here we have our friendly home electrician&ndash;me. The switches in the 4 gang electrical workbox all operate perfectly. A happy camper indeed&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/IMG_2259_400x600.png" alt="electrical" /></p>

<p>With the electrical rough in complete, we can begin to mud, sand smooth, and then prime-coat the walls. Dry wall and finishing is labor intensive and very messy. This was about as big of a drywall job as I could put up with and I got some help on the finishing work from my brother in law. The job seemed to take forever and was very messy.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/IMG_2380_400x267.png" alt="finishing walls" /></p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/IMG_2379_400x267.png" alt="finishing walls" /></p>

<p>Here you can see the positioning of the recessed lights on the finished side of the basement. Note the mason string line used as a guide to position the lights in two parallel lines across the basement. If you want a straight line, use a very taught string.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/recessed-lights-layout_400x267.png" alt="positioning recessed lights" /></p>

<p>On to the prime coat and finish woodwork. We still have a few places on the walls that need a bit more more attention. I am waiting to do the final touchups until all the woodwork is complete. I found that the installation process for the finish woodworking occasionally tends to ding up the walls here and there. One final fresh coat of paint near the end of the project should take care of everything.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/IMG_4437_400x267.png" alt="finishing walls" /></p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/IMG_4438_400x267.png" alt="finishing walls" /></p>

<p>Here we are now below, into the second build which adds a central soffit to cover the overhead beam and air ducts and finished walls to cover most of the foundation. The second build will complete the division of the basement with an addition of another internal partition with a doorway. The goal for the second build is to complete the living area ceiling, walls, and woodwork&ndash;bringing it into full completion except for the floor. Part of this second build is now complete with woodwork and finish work complete. Note the recessed ceiling lights.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/IMG_2970_400x267.png" alt="furnace room" /></p>

<p>Now we move on to finishing the ugly support posts. We use a combination of a level and a keen line-of-sight to make sure the support posts are aligned with each other and plumb before we start&ndash;they are. I cut some 2x4s to length and run a shallow angled groove down the center. I use two heavy U-bolts on each post to clamp a 2x4 onto the post&ndash;then apply adhesive. We take special care to use only straight 2x4s, and align their surface at the proper position on the post to be parallel with the room wall. This provides a rock-solid and truly aligned nailing surface for the first piece of poplar 1x8 woodwork which is glued and nailed onto the 2x4. We make sure to use a level to plumb the first poplar 1x8 for a good start on each post.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/post-finishing-1_400x267.png" alt="post finishing 1" /></p>

<p>With the first piece nailed and glued directly to the 2x4, we now work our way around the post, nailing each edge of the 1x8 poplar to the edge of the previous piece with a 15 gauge nail gun&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/post-finishing-2_400x267.png" alt="post finishing 2" /></p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/post-finishing-3_400x267.png" alt="post finishing 3" /></p>

<p>Afterwards, we fill nail holes using Minwax Woodfiller, then using a sandpaper stapled to a large wood-block - a sanding block. We sand all of the surfaces first with course, then with fine sandpaper. It takes lots of sanding to get it just right. We dont want to see any machine marks or feel any mis-aligned joints. The finished product is worth the effort. We still have trim to complete at the top and bottom of the posts and will get to that after the ceiling is complete.</p>

<p>The posts are looking great so far and you can also see how the central soffit finished out. The paired electrical workboxes in the soffit are one for electrical supply and another for DMX computer light interface&ndash;added to the project for fun and entertainment&ndash;this place is eventually going to rock!</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/post-finishing-4_400x267.png" alt="post finishing 4" /></p>

<p>We are now getting ready to apply the ceiling material on the uppermost ceiling surface at the floor joists, which will be a tongue-and-groove solid wood SPF siding product. The ceiling material will be nailed to a sub-ceiling that we build out using 1.5&#8221; x 0.75&#8221; firring strips. Below we are using a laser level&ndash;my friend Rich loaned it to me. The masking tape markers are carefully stuck in place, using the laser level, to the desired position for the sub-ceiling&ndash;very close to the the floor joists. The folded tape ends provide a perfectly flat guide for the sub-ceiling nailers which will be glued and nailed to the level of tape markers.</p>

<p>Trying to forgo the firring strips and nail the ceiling directly to the floor joists would create far too much height variation in the finished ceiling because the bottoms of the floor joists are not leveled perfectly with each other. Floor joists tend to be crowned and flat to various degrees. Their with can vary in some cases. Loading on the upper deck can cause some variations as well. The firring strips make it all come out perfectly flat.</p>

<p>Here the sub-ceiling nailers are going into place at the exact position the masking tape markers were hung. This effectively flattens the ceiling in preparation for the finished product. The clamp was used as a helping hand to hold up the nailer while it is being positioned and nailed.</p>

<p>I like to keep the tools together and organized. This helps prevent me from spending too much time in search of tools that were left laying around.</p>

<p>Using a 15 gauge nail gun really saves time. You can see how the clamp is used to make handling and aligning the material much easer while nailing it.</p>

<p>More sub-ceiling nailers going into place. The entire sub-ceiling is coming out perfectly flat&ndash;just what we need.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/ceiling-leveling-2_400x267.png" alt="sub-ceiling progress" /></p>

<p>We use a string to mark and position the first piece of ceiling material. A tight string does not lie&ndash;it gives you a perfectly straigt line to work from.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/string-layout-1_400x267.png" alt="sub-ceiling progress" /></p>

<p>We transfer the line produced by the string onto the subceiling nailers. This line markes the position for the first piece of &frac34; inch ceiling material. We want to get a perfectly aligned and straight start&ndash;to which the remaining material will be aligned to. We could have used a chalk line but I didn&rsquo;t want to bother with blue chalk dust cleanup afterwards.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/string-layout-2_400x267.png" alt="sub-ceiling progress" /></p>

<p>Here is the start on the ceiling for one section of the basement. The material is nailed using 2 inch 15 gauge nails driven from a Senco nail gun. First piece is spot glued and nailed on both edges of the material&ndash;we want a good foundation piece that will not move. The second and remaining &frac34; inch SPF material is spot glued and nailed at the leading edge, just behind the tongue, to the sub-ceiling nailers. The job is rather cumbersome and requires two people to position, hold, and nail each piece into place. The ceiling is extremely solid&ndash;you can bounce a basketball against it. It adds to the stiffness and structure of the flooring system directly above it.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/ceiling-finish-start_400x300.png" alt="sub-ceiling progress" /></p>

<p>The natural wood is really looking great so far. The edges will be eventually be finished out with crown molding, nail holes filled, and a final coat of finish will be applied to the entire ceiling. This is the small section of basement ceiling. On the other side of the soffit the ceiling area is at least 3 times the size of this one. &hellip;we still have lots of ceiling work to do.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/ceiling_400x267.png" alt="upper ceiling and soffit" /></p>

<p>Getting back to working on the ceiling I find that I am working mainly on my own. I decided to make a set of support brackets to help install the ceiling material on the larger side of the basement. I need something to hold the material in place with enough force so that it will stay in place and allow me to adjust it before nailing it. What I learned from working on the smaller side is that it is very difficult to hold the first piece and others in place before nailing them. These brackets below will allow me to position and secure the piece before nailing it. I took some quick measurements and spent 30 minutes or so making these from scrap material. The bracket is designed to slide along the sub-ceiling nailers.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/support-bracket-2_400x460.png" alt="upper ceiling and soffit" /></p>

<p>You can see how the foam wedge provides enough force to hold the material firmly against the ceiling. This is great. It allows me to carfully align the material before nailing it. I am just getting started on the first row of material on the larger section of ceiling.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/support-bracket-use-1_400x267.png" alt="upper ceiling and soffit" /></p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/support-bracket-use-2_400x254.png" alt="upper ceiling and soffit" /></p>

<p>All of the end cuts are made on a compound miter saw. I really like the DeWalt&ndash;it is easy to use and cuts perfectly.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/saw-crosscut-1_400x267.png" alt="upper ceiling and soffit" /></p>

<p>I have the saw set to undercut each piece by a few degrees. This helps prevent visual gaps when butted to another piece of material.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/saw-overcut_4639_400x267.png" alt="upper ceiling and soffit" /></p>

<p>The first row of material has been spot-glued and nailed in place. It is looking as straight as the string we used earlier to mark the position. Using the support-brackets made a big difference in the amount of effort. It takes me far less effort now, working alone, than it did earlier with two people trying to align and muscle the material around without the bracket.</p>

<p><img src="/images-basement/first-run-west-side-1_400x267.png" alt="upper ceiling and soffit" /></p>

<p>After completing the open ceilings, we will be adding crown molding and finishing out the woodwork down the walls and at the floor base. Although we still have lots of work to do to complete the second build, the basement living area is starting to look like a great place to hang out.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more as we complete the project&hellip;</p>
